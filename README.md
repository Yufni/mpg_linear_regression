The objective was to create a linear regression to predict the MPG(Miles Per Gallon) consumption.

### Please check this [notebook](/mpg_linear_regression.ipynb) to find 

The 80% of data was used to train the model and 20% remaining for test.

The result was a model with Mean Squared Error (Error) of 12.22 and r2 Score (Accuracy) of 0.8011605762467994.
