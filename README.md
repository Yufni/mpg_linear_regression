This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition.

You can find my own variation with consecutive ID added [here](https://gist.github.com/YufniCastro/dff968b38a5102606657de8760f67856).

The objective was to create a linear regression to predict the MPG(Miles Per Gallon) consumption.

### Please refer to this [notebook](/mpg_linear_regression.ipynb) to see the process in detail.

The 80% of data was used to train the model and 20% remaining for test.

The result was a model with Mean Squared Error (Error) of 12.22 and r2 Score (Accuracy) of 0.8011605762467994.
